Working Progress


To run: 

- Need a folder called data, which contains the atlas data. And a folder called Other_data that contains the data from other sources (this was created using the other_data.R)

-> run 0_data_cleaning_atlas.R

-> combine_datasets.R (adds data from other sources)

-> then run_regresssions.R. This take a long time but creates all the models and saves them.
